# Python Dictionary
Here is all my python code which I wrote along the different tutorials (p4e, data science, 100 days of code). It is meant to serve as a dictionary where to look up certain topics.

I switched to jupyter notebooks recently, so it may take some time until I copied all the code from repl.it to jupyter.
